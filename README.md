# Serverless Blog Platform

## Project Overview

Develop a serverless blog platform using AWS CDK. The platform should allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The architecture should be simple, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Detailed Requirements

1. **User Authentication:**

   - **Cognito User Pool:** For user registration, authentication, and authorization.

2. **Blog Post Management:**

   - **DynamoDB:** For storing blog post information (Post ID, title, content, author, timestamp, etc.).
   - **API Gateway and Lambda:** For CRUD operations on blog posts.

3. **Frontend Hosting:**

   - **S3 and CloudFront:** To host and serve the static frontend assets.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - **CloudWatch:** For logging and monitoring application metrics.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Set up Cognito for user management.**

   - Create a user pool.
   - Configure user pool client and permissions.

2. **Design a DynamoDB table for blog posts.**

   - Define primary keys and necessary attributes.

3. **Create API Gateway and Lambda functions for blog post operations.**

   - Implement RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
   - Use Lambda to interact with DynamoDB.

4. **Configure S3 and CloudFront for frontend hosting.**

   - Deploy static assets to S3.
   - Configure CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket.

5. **Set up monitoring and logging with CloudWatch.**
   - Enable CloudWatch logging for API Gateway and Lambda.

## Advanced Challenges

- **Security:** Implement IAM roles and policies to ensure least privilege access.
- **Performance:** Optimize Lambda functions and DynamoDB queries for performance and cost.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and blog posts.

## Goal

This project will help you gain experience in building a simple serverless application using AWS CDK while keeping the requirements manageable. Enjoy building your serverless blog platform!
